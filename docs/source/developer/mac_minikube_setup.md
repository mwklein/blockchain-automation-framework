# Setting up a development environment on Mac OSX

## Install Kubectl using Homebrew

Use a package manager of your choice to install kubectl. In this guide, Homebrew was used. Installation guide for Homebrew could be found [here](https://brew.sh).

Install kubectl with homebrew:<br/>  `brew install kubectl` <br/><br/>

## Install Minikube using Homebrew

Using Homebrew package manager, enter the following command: <br/>  `brew install minikube`

Add minikube executable to your path:  `sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin`

Letâ€™s confirm the minikube was installed correctly by starting your first cluster:<br/> `minikube start`

*NOTE:* Minikube uses port in range 30000-32767. If you would like to change it, use command bellow:

`minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.service-node-port-range=15000-20000`

*NOTE:* For increase memory of virtual machine of Minikube, use command bellow:

`minikube start --memory 4096`

And now we will check the status: `minikube status`. You should see an output that looks similar to this:

```
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured
```

## Install Hashicorp Vault

Install go language if you do not have it installed. Installation guide for go could be found [here](https://golang.org).


Make sure you have **GOPATH** environment variable in your PATH. One way to do this is to edit ~/.bash_profile and add the following:<br/>
```
export GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go<br/>
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```


Once you set the GOPATH environment variable, follow the installation guide for [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install/#precompiled-binaries).<br/><br/>

For getting URL address of Vault in minikube, use command bellow:

`minikube service vault --url`

## Install Ansible using PIP

The recommended method for installing Ansible is to use pip, see    [Ansible instruction](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-pip).

When you use pip to install Ansible, pip will not include the configuration file, ansible.cfg . Therefore, you will need to create a folder in the /etc directory:

`mkdir /etc/ansible`

Add a file called hosts and copy the contents from this [page](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-automation-framework/blob/master/platforms/shared/inventory/ansible_provisoners). 



You do not need to install Ambassador in a Dev environment.

## Install Kubernetes module into Ansible

The recommended module for Ansible is Kubernetes.
When you have installed Ansible on you Mac, then you install Kubernetes module via pip.

`pip install openshift --user`

or if you use python3, then you use command bellow:

`python3 -m pip install openshift --user`

## Install other prerequisites

### GNU Tar
Some Ansible roles use Tar for unpack packages. Mac OSX has installed Tar, but the roles use GNU version of Tar tool.
Use `brew` tool for installation:

`brew install gnu-tar`
### JQ
Some Ansible roles use JQ for parsing JSONs and read fields of the JSON objects.
You need install JQ tool via `brew` tool.

`brew install jq`

## Editing the network configuration file

Add the following to the top of the network-fabricv2.yaml (or any other network.yaml) file:

```
install_os: "darwin"                #Default to linux OS
install_arch:  "amd64"              #Default to amd64 architecture
bin_install_dir:  "/usr/local/bin"      #Default to /bin install directory for 
```
Use `uname -a` to verify that darwin is the architecture code for your operating system. If it's not, then change the install_os accordingly. <br/><br/>


**cloud_provider** : change from `aws` to `minikube`

**k8s** : comment out or remove provider and region. Change context to "minikube" (as that is the default context when you install minikube, if not used the context from the Kubeconfig file) and config_file to the path of the Kubeconfig file. You should be able to find the config file in the .kube directory. The k8s paramaters should look similar to this:
```
k8s:
   #  provider: "EKS"
   #  region: "cluster_region"
   context: "minikube"
   config_file: "/Users/username/.kube/config" 
```

## Gettin IP address of Minikube for organizations nodes
If you need public address for nodes in your `network.yaml` file, you can use command bellow:

`minikube ip`

 ## Potential issues when using Ansible playbook to setup DLT Network on OSX

* If you get an error message "_the required library is installed, but Ansible is using the wrong Python interpreter"_, you will need to specify which interpreter to use when running the ansible-playbook using the following extra-parameter

   `ansible-playbook -e "ansible_python_interpreter=/pathtopython/bin/python3" -e "otherparameters" playbook.yaml`

   You can find the path of python3 by executing `which python3`<br/>

* If ansible is stuck on a task where it checks to see if Tiller is installed in the Kubernetes clusters and you get a message similar to this: 
_"MODULE FAILURE\nSee stdout/stderr for the exact error"_, It is probably because the kubernetes version is 16 or higher. You will need to delete the kubernetes cluster and create a another cluster with v1.15.4 using the following command. 

   `minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox --kubernetes-version v1.15.4` <br/>

  
* It is recommended that you use virtual box as the vm driver when deploying the DLT network. If you use hyperkit as the vm driver, your k8 cluster will not have access to the internet.
